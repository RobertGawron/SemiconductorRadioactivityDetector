# Hardware

* [Semiconductor Radioactivity Detector](./SemiconductorRadioactivityDetector) - the main project for the sensor.
* [Power Supply + Logic Level Converter](./PowerSupply/) - auxiliary board to provide stable and low-noise power to the sensor, and to convert logic levels from 12V (high) and 0V (low) — as output by the sensor — to 3.3V (high) and 0V (low), which is standard for STM32 and cheap Chinese logic analyzers.
