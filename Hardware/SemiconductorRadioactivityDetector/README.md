# Extra Modifications

* As close as possible to the input power socket, I placed 1n/16V and 100n/16V capacitors in parallel. Without them, the device began oscillating randomly.
* A Schottky diode is connected in series after the extra capacitors mentioned above to reduce the risk of damaging the device when the power supply is connected incorrectly. I'm not sure if it will help enough, but Iâ€™ve already damaged one PCB this way, so now it's included.
