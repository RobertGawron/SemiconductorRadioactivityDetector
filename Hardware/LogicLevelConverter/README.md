# LogicLevelConverter

The digital output is 12V in the high state and 0V in the low state, which is not very useful for the 3.3V logic microcontroller I'm using for data acquisition. To solve this, I built a simple converter on an additional PCB.

Here, you can see it soldered.

What I like about these SMA female sockets is that they can be soldered to the edge of the PCB (as shown below), making them mechanically stable without the need to drill holes, unlike the regular mounting method.

Note that there is no PCB design; a breadboard is used for assembly.
