# Software

* [DataAcquisition](./DataAcquisition) - This is an old version that used Python and R scripts for data collection and processing. It was done a long time ago, and I forgot what packages need to be installed for it to work. I'll keep this for its simplicity, but in the future, I plan to add a Docker container to simplify the setup.
* [HardwareDataLogger](./HardwareDataLogger) - This is an ongoing, much better solution with STM32 as the main controller. It has the ability to store data via WiFi, on an SD card, or directly to a PC, but it is not finished yet.
