The deployment diagrams were generated from the ArchitectureOverview.plantuml file using the [PlantUML online service](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/).

Although PlantUML is open-source and can be installed locally, the diagrams are rarely modified, so I haven't set up a local installation yet. However, in the future, I might create a Docker image with PlantUML preconfigured to streamline the diagram generation process.
