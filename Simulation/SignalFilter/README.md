# Filtration of Output Signal Using a Digital Filter

This is an initial attempt to see how digital signal filtering could help in reducing noise. While writing this simulation, I didnâ€™t have access to the actual device, so I couldn't use precise values. Nevertheless, it seems this approach will be a useful way to improve signal quality.
